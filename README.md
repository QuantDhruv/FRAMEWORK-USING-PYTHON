# 🚗 Car Inspection Camera Framework – Step-by-Step

## 1. Why This Framework? (Problem Statement)
🔴 Without a standardized process, capturing vehicle images is inefficient.

- Photos are inconsistent (wrong angles, poor alignment).
- Manual adjustments take extra time.
- Image storage is unstructured, making retrieval difficult.
- Errors occur, such as missing images or incorrect positioning.

## 2. What Does This Framework Do? (Solution)
✅ Provides a guided camera system with overlays for proper alignment.
✅ Automates image capturing & storage with timestamps.
✅ Uses keyboard shortcuts to speed up the process.
✅ Ensures structured & consistent vehicle images for AI-based analysis, insurance claims, and fleet management.

## 3. How It Works? (Step-by-Step Execution)
### Step 1: Camera Initialization
- The system detects and activates the camera.
- If no camera is found, it displays an error and exits.

### Step 2: Display Overlay Guides
- Four overlay images (`car_left.png`, `car_right.png`, etc.) guide the user.
- Each overlay helps align the vehicle correctly in the frame.

### Step 3: Capture Images
- The user presses `Space` to take a photo.
- The image is saved automatically with a timestamp.
- The overlay switches to the next required angle.

### Step 4: Complete the Capture Process
- This repeats until all four views (left, right, front, rear) are captured.
- After capturing all images, the system displays a success message.

### Step 5: Exit the Program
- The user can press `Q` to exit at any time.
- If overlays are missing, the system skips to the next available overlay.
